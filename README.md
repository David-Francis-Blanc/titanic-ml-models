# Titanic ML Models (Week 3â€“4 Capstone)

This project contains machine learning models developed as part of a 4-week ML course. The models predict Titanic survival based on passenger data. It includes Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning and stratified sampling.

## Files
- `titanic_rf_stratified.py`: Final Week 4 script with stratified sampling.
- `titanic_rf_tuning.py`: Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV.
- `titanic_boosting.py`: Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost models.
- `titanic_feature_engineering.py`: Preprocessing script (scaling, encoding).
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset used for training/testing (place in same folder).

## How to Run
```bash
python titanic_rf_stratified.py
